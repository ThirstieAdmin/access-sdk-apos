    - **Major Version**: Introduces incompatible changes in the API or application. There should be compelling business reasons, on top of technical concerns, when the interface changes. 
    - **Minor Version**: Introduces new features in a backward compatible manner. Note that this can include deprecations that do not impact the overall use of the platform.
    - **Patch**: Fixes to restore previously documented behavior or to improve obvious shortcomings of new features. Also includes security and dependency upgrades.
